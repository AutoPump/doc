# ⚙️ How AutoPump Works

A clever design where each transaction feeds into a mechanism that's all about the rise. The smart contracts ensure a continuous cycle. Collect, accumulate, and when the moment's right, power up the price by buying and burning tokens. No pause, all play.

* **Fee Collection:** With each transaction, AutoPump collects a small fee.
* **AutoPump Fund:** This fee goes into the AutoPump fund, like a piggy bank that's only for buying and burning AutoPump tokens.
* **Trigger Point:** Once the fund hits a set amount, the AutoPump triggers automatically.
* **Buyback and Burn:** AutoPump uses the collected funds to buy back tokens from the market and then burns them, permanently reducing the supply.
